# CiscoIOSScripts
Repo for useful Cisco IOS scripts made with <a href='https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko'>paramiko</a>.

Previously, I had a repo for each of the scripts, but that was messy. This will be the repo for all Cisco IOS scripts that use
paramiko.

These scripts have been useful to me, but idk how useful they will be for others. They're here if you need them.

* mac2port
  * Script that checks for a MAC address on a switch and reports back the port it lives on.
* CiscoIPProtoPeers
  * Script that checks all of the BGP, OSPF, and EIGRP peers of this Cisco device and lists them.
